18. Setup Repository and Service

-> Contracts	-> IRepository.cs		(FindAll, FindById, Create, Update, Delete, Save)	: base functionality
				-> IAuthorService.cs	(we create it so if later we want to add additional functionality we can)
-> Servicies	-> AuthorRepository.cs	(FindAll, FindById, Create, Update, Delete, Save)

Task<IList<T>> FindAll();
Task<T> FindById(int id);
Task<bool> isExists(int id);
Task<bool> Create(T entity);
Task<bool> Update(T entity);
Task<bool> Delete(T entity);
Task<bool> Save();

-> the interfaces for Book and Author are created in case we want to add 
specific functionality to them that are not in the BaseClass


-> Save() 
	_db.SaveChangesAsync() : return the number of state entries written to the database.

-> Create(Book entity)
	_db.Books.AddAsync(entity) : -> Begins tracking the given entity, and any other reachable entities 
								 that are not already being tracked, that they will be inserted into 
								 the database when EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext.SaveChanges is called
								 -> This method is async only to allow special value generators
								 -> For all other cases the non async method should be used.

-> Delete(Book entity)
	 _db.Books.Remove(entity) : Begins tracking the given entity in the EntityFrameworkCore.EntityState.Deleted
								state such that it will be removed from the database when 
								EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext.SaveChanges is called.

-> FindAll()
	_db.Books.ToListAsync()	  : Asynchronously creates a System.Collections.Generic.List`1 from an 
								System.Linq.IQueryable`1 by enumerating it asynchronously.

-> FindById(int id)	
	db.Books.FindAsync(id)	  :	Finds an entity with the given primary key values. If an entity with the given
								primary key values is being tracked by the context, then it is returned immediately
								without making a request to the database. Otherwise, a query is made to the database
								for an entity with the given primary key values and this entity, if found, is
								attached to the context and returned. If no entity is found, then null is returned.

-> isExists(int id)
	_db.Books.AnyAsync(q => q.Id== id) :  is there any book with the property Id == the value coming 
										  in through this call and then return the his value

-> Update(Book entity)
	 _db.Books.Update(entity);


-- AuthorRepository.cs --

-> create contructor so we can access the data: ApplicationDbContext
-> create the methods: FindAll, FindById, Create, Update, Delete, Save

SaveChangeAsync():	-> Saves all changes made in this context to the database.
					-> This method will automatically call Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.ChangeTracking.ChangeTracker.DetectChanges
					to discover any changes to entity instances before saving to the underlying database
					-> return the number of state entries written to the database.
ToListAsync()	:	-> return a list of the specified objects
FindAsync()		:	-> 	Finds an entity with the given primary key values. If an entity with the given primary key values 
					is being tracked by the context, then it is returned immediatelywithout making a request to the database. 
					Otherwise, a query is made to the databasefor an entity with the given primary key values and this entity, 
					if found, isattached to the context and returned. If no entity is found, then null is returned.
AddAsync()		:	
Update()		:
Remove()		:


19. Scoped vs Singleton vs Transient


Singleton	: Caching Services, Global Configuration, Business Rules, HttpClients 
			  Persisting state that's useful for the runtime of the application

Scoped		: Persisting state throughtout application per request

Transient	: Data Access, File Access
			  Services that should dispose of their state
			  When you need a fresh instance of an object every single time

20. Setup API Controller

-- StartUp.cs -- 

servicies.AddScoped<IAuthorRepository, AuthorRepository>();

Controller -> AuthorsController.cs 

-> create a constructor passing a param of Type IAuthorRepository, so we can have access to the class
AuthorRepository, that has all the methods(FindAll, FindById, Create, Update, Delete, Save) with all the 
data colected from the DB
-> pass param logger for the Logger Messages 

public AuthorsController( IAuthorRepository authorRepository, 
						  ILoggerService logger,
						  IMapper mapper
						){}

-> in AuthorRepository we have a contructor that access all the data from DB : ApplicationDbContext db


21. Setup GET Endpoints

<IActionResult> : we have more to return then ActionResult

-> we are not interaction directly with our Data classes, but with our DTOs classes
-> the controller talks to the DTOs, automapper will Map between Data and DTOs
-> our repository will call the Data object and then we will map it to the DTOs(Author.cs-> AuthorDTO.cs)
and return the DTOs object that is calling the API

-> use Try, Catch
[HttpPost]
-> GetAuthors() :	-> get the authors	
					-> map the Author to the AuthorDTO
					-> return Ok(response);		
[HttpPost({"id"})]					
-> GetAuthor()	:
-> add _Logger 
-> add the documentation for each HTTP method
-> add StatusCode to the Methods so we can see it on the Swagger


22. Setup CREATE Endpoint

Create new AuthorDTO class	: DTOs -> AuthorDTO -> AuthorCreateDTO (FirstName, LastName, Bio)
Map the new class DTOCreate : Mapping -> Maps.cs -> CreateMap<Author, AuthorCreateDTO>().ReverseMap();
            
-- AuthorsController.cs --

-> Create()

ModelState: tracking the validation status of the data

if(ModelState.IsValid == false){} -> check if the conditions created in the class ([Required], .....)
									 are met, then ...  


23. Setup UPDATE Endpoint

-> DTOs -> AuthorDTO -> AuthorUpdateDTO
-> Mapping -> Maps.cs -> CreateMap<Author, AuthorUpdateDTO>().ReverseMap();

-- AuthorsController.cs --

->  Update(int id, [FromBody] AuthorUpdateDTO authorDTO)


24. PUT vs PATCH

 https://rapidapi.com/blog/put-vs-patch/

 -> if we have a request https://domain.com/house/1
 {
	"front_patio": true,
	"back_patio": true,
	"windows": 12,
	"doors": 4,
	"Balcony": false
}

-> and we only send :
{
	"doors": 5
}

-> PUT request overwrites everything.
-> PATCH request overwrites only that field

Note: calling HTTP PATCH on a resource that doesn’t exist is bound to fail and no resource will be created


25. Setup DELETE EndPoint

Contracts -> IRepositoryBase.cs : Task<bool> isExists(int id);
Services -> AuthorRepository.cs : Task<bool> isExists(int id);

-- AuthorsController.cs --

-> Delete()
